This book updates the 1st edition of Bayesian Statistical Modelling and, like its predecessor,
seeks to provide an overview of modelling strategies and data analytic methodology from
a Bayesian perspective. The book discusses and reviews a wide variety of modelling and
application areas from a Bayesian viewpoint, and considers the most recent developments in
what is often a rapidly changing intellectual environment.
The particular package that is mainly relied on for illustrative examples in this 2nd edition
is again WINBUGS (and its parallel development in OPENBUGS). In the author’s experience this remains a highly versatile tool for applying Bayesian methodology. This package
allows effort to be focused on exploring alternative likelihood models and prior assumptions,
while detailed specification and coding of parameter sampling mechanisms (whether Gibbs or
Metropolis-Hastings) can be avoided – by relying on the program’s inbuilt expert system to
choose appropriate updating schemes.
